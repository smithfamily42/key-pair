## Key-Pair

# Description
Command Line Interface for user input of key pairs (i.e. favorite_dog Rodrigo)

# Contraints
Working with only built in libraries create a CLI that prompts for key-value pairs.
Use push to store the key values
Use fetch to retrieve the value with the prompted key
Use exit to leave the interface

# Challenges
Learning to do tasks that I would normally use additional packages/modules with standard language implementation
* started with process.argv and found this was not viable
* looked into standard input and readline https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/command-line/how-to-prompt-for-command-line-input/

# Future development
I still have much to learn. This presented me with a challenge I was not prepared for and needed to do considerable research.
I have not even gotten to the logic to make this behave the way it should to accomplish the task.
